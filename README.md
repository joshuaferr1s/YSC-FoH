# YSC Front of House

A simple system to track and report the tickets sold at each screening. The program can upload this data to a Google spreadsheet including a time analysis. It may not be pretty but it works.

## Getting Started

Simply download this repository and then cd into the folder where you saved it and run the foh.py file with Python 3 for a terminal display or gui.py file with Python 3 for a clickable interface. For example, on mac this would look like so for the graphical interface:
```python
cd path/to/file
python3 gui.py
```
